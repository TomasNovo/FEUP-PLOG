The 1st project of PLOG was to implement a board game with Prolog language.
Knight's Line is a game that involves Chess and Four in a Row.
The game starts with two (black and white) stacks of 20 pieces. 
User can move the stacks but always has to leave 1 piece behind. 
The stack can only me moved in L and has to have another stack adjacent to it.

The game starts with the two adjacent stacks and user inputs the X and Y of 
the stack that he wants to move. But on the 1st move, user can only move 1 piece.
