# FEUP PLOG 2018/19

Programming in Prolog with and without restrictions for PLOG 2018/2019 at FEUP.


## 1.	Knight's Line

The 1st project of PLOG was to implement a board game with Prolog language.
Knight's Line is a game that involves Chess and Four in a Row.
The game starts with two (black and white) stacks of 20 pieces. 
User can move the stacks but always has to leave 1 piece behind. 
The stack can only me moved in L and has to have another stack adjacent to it.
It will win the color that has 4 adjacent pieces in four adjacent tiles in any direction.


• Using the interface, the user can choose the type of game he wants to play.

• The game starts with the two adjacent stacks and user inputs the X and Y of 
the stack that he wants to move. But on the 1st move, **user can only move 1 piece**.

• After choosing the stack, letters that show possible moves will appear and user
has to input the move like for example: 'A'.

• After the input, the stack will move to the inputed tile.
